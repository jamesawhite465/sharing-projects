    "### From this rather simple analysis we can see that there is a clear difference in the percentage of <br> Established and Veteran dissatisfied workers (being noticeably higher than the less experienced <br> groups). From this it could be that the longer people work the more dissatisfied they become with <br>any company (we would need more employee data from other companies for this perhaps using <br>cluster sampling). Another reason could be the employees start to realise the flaws within DETE <br>and TAFE after working there for an extended period of time. No doubt there are other possible <br>reasons that will be overlooked for now.\n"
